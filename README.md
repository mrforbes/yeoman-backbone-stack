yeoman-backbone-stack
=====================

Directory / Config for Yeoman + Require + Backbone + SASS + Bootstrap + Mocha + Testacular

What is it?
--------------

A skeleton framework for using the stack outlined above. 

Why?
-------------
There is some config work that needs to be done to get all of these pieces working together correctly - especially the require/testacular integration. I did all of the work, so if you find this repo you can reap the benefits.

What else do I need?
-----------
In order for this to be of any use to you, you'll also have to install:

+ Node: (http://nodejs.org)
+ Yeoman: (http://yeoman.io)
+ Testacular (http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/)

As well as some other Yeoman dependencies, but it'll guide you through those.

Usage
-------
Once you have the dependencies installed, go to the directory where you installed this in your command line and type yeoman start && yeoman server

Or if you already have some other preferred way of doing these types of things (sublime maybe?) - then use that.
